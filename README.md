This branch is an example of KMeans Clustering on a TFIDF normalized dataset. The branch contains a jupyter notebook file as well as the downloaded .html file of the notebook. The two text files -- classes and terms -- contain the class each document was initially assigned and the list of terms. The actual .txt containing the TD Matrix was too large to be uploaded here. However, it is printed a few times throughout the notebook.
